            <p>
              I first started the Software Development programme in late January
              and completed the Programming Fundamentals and moved on to the
              Intro to Web course. In my time at CodeSpace Academy I have so far
              learnt how to think differently and realized that every problem
              has a solution, you just have to find it. I have also bettered my
              HTML skills as well as CSS
            </p>

            <p>
              Completed their free Javascript course where I learnt how to use
              Javascript successfully by implementing the coding language to
              complete the course challenges and projects. On the side I would
              also try competing against other members to try and solve various
              challenges.
